# BIO_350_F25

Starting our BIO350 assignments repo.

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- Making a difference equation
- Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on
- It works!

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed covers a pond
- Minimal technical difficulties but better
- Installed matplotlib and made our first plot!

IC_InClass1.ipynb
- Here we used the code from IC Assignment 2 to make a logarithmic graph and we used else if statements to change the rate of growth of duckweed based on the total area covered.

IC_Assignment3.ipynb
- Made a logistic growth model almost all by myself
- Originally I had a somewhat decent one that reached carrying capacity way too fast but it was still logistic
- Once I figured out how to properly add the birth and death rates the growth sloped out more and the model was more like what we expected

IC_InClassExample2.ipynb
- For this we installed pandas
- We then imported data and made a graph out of it showing population growth
- We then used copilot to add a line of the carrying capacity and change around our axises and line color

IC_Assignment4.ipynb
- For this assignment we were once again using a log equation but adding in competition between two species
- I started with my code from assignment 3
- I figured out that my code was a little repetitive so we were able to take out a good chunk of it
- Then I added in the section that shows the growth of the other species for their competition
- After plotting the results you are able to see how the competition drives one of the species to extinction
