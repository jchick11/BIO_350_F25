Starting our BIO350 assignments repo.

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- Making a difference equation
- Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on
- It works!

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed covers a pond
- Minimal technical difficulties but better
- Installed matplotlib and made our first plot!

IC_InClass1.ipynb
- Here we used the code from IC Assignment 2 to make a logarithmic graph and we used else if statements to change the rate of growth of duckweed based on the total area covered.
